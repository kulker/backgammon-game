# backgammon-game
Backgammon Game coded with HTML5 - Javascript

It's a game I developed years ago.

I remember writing code for the game for days.

The game works, only the backend for multiplayer needs to be prepared and completed.

I was planning to do the backend part with Node.js, I didn't have time.

I hope someone will like and complete this game.
